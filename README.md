# RPVendorTracker

## Entities (Models)
 - Items
  - item attributes (rarity, category... etc)
 - Vendors
  - vendor attributes (age, race, weight, gender... etc)
 - ListInterface
  - Interface meant to allow Items and Vendors to be referenced by a single pointer
  - Interfaces don't seem to work as I thought they would've.  (Couldnt do things in Swift that I could do in Java)
## Controllers
